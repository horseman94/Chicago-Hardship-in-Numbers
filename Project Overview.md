# Chicago-in-Numbers
Chicago in Numbers: Exploring Crime, Education, and Inequality.


### Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes key datasets from the City of Chicago to uncover relationships and patterns among socioeconomic factors, public education performance, and crime rates across various neighborhoods. By integrating these datasets, the goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how these elements interact and how they might influence each other in an urban context.



### Data Sources

Years Covered: 2008–2012
