## Socioeconomic Hardship

- The relation between: Hardship Index and Per Capita Income.

The visual clearly demonstrates a strong negative correlation between the two indicators across the Chicago community areas.

Generally, as the Per Capita Income tends to decrease, the Hardship Index increases (indicating greater socioeconomic challenges). Conversely, community areas with a lower Hardship Index typically exhibit a higher Per Capita Income.

- The relation between: Per Capita Income and Percent Aged 16+ Unemployed, as well as the Percent Aged 25+ Without a High School Diploma.

The top graph shows a general inverse relationship with unemployment, suggesting that higher income is often associated with lower unemployment.

The bottom graph reveals a strong negative correlation between income and the percentage of adults without a high school diploma, emphasizing the critical role of education in economic well-being across Chicago's neighborhoods.

- The relation between: Hardship Index and Percent Aged 16+ Unemployed, as well as the Percent Aged 25+ Without a High School Diploma.

Both visuals highlight key socioeconomic factors contributing to the Hardship Index in Chicago community areas. The positive correlation observed in both graphs suggests that higher unemployment rates and lower levels of educational attainment are strongly associated with greater overall hardship within these neighborhoods.

### Conclusion

"Our analysis reveals that economic hardship in Chicago is fundamentally driven by lower per capita incomes. These depressed income levels, in turn, are directly attributable to reduced educational attainment and high unemployment rates within affected communities. Consequently, strategic investments in both education and job creation are crucial to alleviating hardship across the city."
