## Chicago Public School Safety

This report utilizes Power BI's "Key Influencers" visualization to explore the factors that significantly impact a school's "Safety Score."  By automatically analyzing various explanatory factors, the tool provides a clear, data-driven understanding of the drivers behind safety improvements or decline.

Our analysis reveals several critical factors that positively influence a school's Safety Score, indicating areas where strategic focus could yield improvements:

- Adequate Yearly Progress Made: The most significant influencer. Its average Safety Score is notably higher, increasing by approximately 33.33 points on average compared to schools that do not meet AYP. This suggests that overall academic and operational success, as measured by AYP, is strongly linked to a safer school environment.

- Average Student Attendance: High student attendance also plays a substantial role. When the "Average Student Attendance" is more than 95.3%, the Safety Score increases by approximately 21.34 points on average.

- ISAT Value Add Read: The "ISAT Value Add Read" metric, which measures student growth in reading, is another significant influencer. When a school's "ISAT Value Add Read" is greater than -1.2 (indicating positive or near-positive student growth in reading), the Safety Score increases by approximately 17.87 points on average.

In conclusion, this analysis clearly demonstrates that school safety is not an isolated factor but is deeply interconnected with academic achievement, student engagement, and educational progress. Schools that make Adequate Yearly Progress, maintain high student attendance, and show strong student growth in reading are more likely to achieve higher Safety Scores. These findings underscore the holistic nature of school improvement, where academic success and student well-being mutually reinforce a positive and safe learning environment.
